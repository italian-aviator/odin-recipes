        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p><em>Pasta alla carbonara</em> is a typical italian dish that originated in the city of Rome.
         It is simply pasta with a sauce that is made from raw eggs, pecorino cheese, pepper and guanciale, the pig's cheek.
        There's still a lot of arguments regarding what type of pasta to use, but don't worry, I won't be talking about that here.
        The dish is fairly heavy and not raccomended for someone on a diet.
        Although the recipe is fairly simple, it's easy to mess up by cooking the egg and producing a type of frittata... not the best experince.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Ingredients are roughly calculated for 4 people, quantity may vary based on how angy you are.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pasta 600g</li>
            <li>Eggs 6</li>
            <li>Guanciale 300g</li>
            <li>pecorino cheese as needed (about 80/100g)</li>
            <li>pepper as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember that <em>Pasta alla carbonara</em>isn't meant to be difficult so don't stress too much about the quantity. Do it as you like it, that's what matter.</p>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the guanciale, if this is already done skip this step.</li>
            <li>Put the guanciale in a big enough pan and start cooking it until it's crispy. Do not add any oil, its fat will be sufficient.</li>
            <li>Start cooking the pasta (For those of you who don't know how to do it: boil the water, add some salt, put the pasta in for the amount of time reported in the package).</li>
            <li>Separate the eggs' yolk from the egg white.</li>
            <li>Add to the pecorino cheese and the pepper to the yolk.</li>
            <li>Mix until the sauce becomes dense and difficult to mix, be careful not to form any lump.</li>
            <li>Add the liquid fat from the guanciale to the sauce. <strong>Attention</strong>: the fat may be hot and might cook the egg, for this reason add it slowly and while mixing.</li>
            <li>Optional: add more pecorino cheese and pepper.</li>
            <li>Add some cooking water to the sauce to make it more fluid shortly before the pasta is done cooking.</li>
            <li>Drain the pasta and add it in the pan with the guanciale.</li>
            <li>Turn on the heat at a low intensity.</li>
            <li>Start adding the sauce while moving the pan on and off the heat and while mixing it all.</li>
            <li>Switch off the heat and serve the pasta after a shower of pecorino cheese.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
